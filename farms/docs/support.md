# Support

If you are experiencing technical difficulties while writing code or interacting with the Safecoin blockchain, ask your questions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RxeGBH), [Telegram](https://t.me/solana), or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/solana) (tag your question with `solana`).

If you have Safecoin Farms specific questions or issues integrating Farms code, feel free to ask in the `developer-support` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RxeGBH), but please mention that this is `safecoin farms` related. Or reach out to solana.farms@protonmail.com and provide your name, a link to the project website (if there is one), and a detailed description of the problem.

If you found a bug in the code, you can raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/fair-exchange/safecoin-program-library). But if this is a security issue, please don't open it on Github or disclose it in public channels. Send information to the email above instead.
