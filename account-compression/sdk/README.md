# Account Compression SDK

Currently contains a typescript SDK to interact with on-chain SPL ConcurrentMerkleTrees.

Used to test Account Compression program.

# Setting up the Safeita-based Typescript SDK

1. Generate the Safeita SDK with `yarn solita`.

2. Then build the SDK with `yarn build`.

# Testing the SDK

Run `yarn test`. Expect `jest` to detect an open handle that prevents it from exiting tests naturally.
